# Setting Up Your Shell Environment

Welcome to your new account! Follow these steps to set up your shell environment with Oh My Zsh and Powerlevel10k for an enhanced terminal experience.

## Step 1: Access the Terminal

First, open your terminal. You can usually find the terminal application in your applications menu or by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

## Step 2: Run the Setup Script

The setup script is located in `/usr/local/bin/global_scripts`. To run the script, enter the following command in your terminal:
```sh
/usr/local/bin/global_scripts/setup_omzp10.sh
```

## Step 3: Follow the Prompts

### Checking for Zsh Installation

The script will first check if Zsh is installed. If Zsh is already installed, it will skip this step. If not, it will prompt you to install Zsh.

- If prompted, install Zsh manually and re-run the script.

### Switching to Zsh

The script will then check if you are running Zsh. If not, it will switch to Zsh and continue the installation.

### Installing Oh My Zsh

If Oh My Zsh is not already installed, the script will ask if you want to install it. Follow the prompt:

- Type `y` and press `Enter` to install Oh My Zsh.
- Type `n` and press `Enter` to skip this step.

### Installing Powerlevel10k

If Powerlevel10k is not already installed, the script will ask if you want to install it. Follow the prompt:

- Type `y` and press `Enter` to install Powerlevel10k.
- Type `n` and press `Enter` to skip this step.

## Step 4: Restart Your Terminal

After the script completes, you need to restart your terminal for the changes to take effect. Close your terminal window and open it again.

## Step 5: Configure Powerlevel10k

The first time you open a terminal with Powerlevel10k, it will prompt you to configure the theme. Follow the on-screen instructions to customize your prompt.

## Enjoy Your Enhanced Shell!

You are now set up with Oh My Zsh and Powerlevel10k. Enjoy your new, powerful, and customizable terminal environment!
