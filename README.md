## Introduction

This repository is a collection of resources for learning together. It is a place to share resources, ask questions, and collaborate on learning projects. The goal is to create a community of learners who can support each other in their learning journey.

The resources in this repository are organized by topic. Each topic has its own folder, which contains a README file with links to resources on that topic. You can also create your own folders and add resources to them.

If you have any questions or need help with anything, feel free to ask in the [Discussions]()
