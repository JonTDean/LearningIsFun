Unsure where to begin contributing to Monastery? You can start by looking through "beginner" and "help-wanted" issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/JonTDean/LetsLearnTogether/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/JonTDean/LetsLearnTogether/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
