This guide walks through the process of creating a new user on a Debian-based system, setting up Samba for that user, and ensuring that the Samba password syncs with the Unix password.

## Step 1: Create a New Unix User

First, create a new Unix user. You can generate a random password for this user.

1. **Generate a Random Password**:
    ```bash
    new_password=$(openssl rand -base64 12)
    echo "Generated Password: $new_password"
    ```

2. **Create the User with the Generated Password**:
    ```bash
    adduser --gecos "" --disabled-password newuser
    echo "newuser:$new_password" | chpasswd
    ```

## Step 2: Add the User to Samba

Next, add the user to Samba and set their password.

1. **Add the User to Samba**:
    ```bash
    smbpasswd -a newuser
    ```
    When prompted, enter the same password you generated in Step 1.


## Step 3: User Password Change

When the user logs in for the first time, they can change their password to something more secure.

1. **User Logs In**:
    The user can log in using their Unix credentials.

2. **Change Password**:
    The user can change their password using the `passwd` command:
    ```bash
    passwd
    ```

After completing these steps, the user's Samba password will be synchronized with their Unix password.

## Troubleshooting

If the user encounters issues accessing Samba shares, ensure that:

- The user is part of the correct Unix groups.
- The Samba configuration is correct and the services are running.
- The user's Samba password was correctly set initially.
