# Example Enhancement Suggestion

**Title:** Addition of a Dark Mode Feature

**Environment:**
- **Software Version:** 3.0.5
- **Platform:** Web

**Description:**
This enhancement involves adding a dark mode feature to the application's user interface. Many users find dark mode reduces eye strain in low-light conditions and prefer it for aesthetic reasons.

**Suggested Enhancement:**
Introduce a toggle switch in the user settings that allows users to switch between standard (light) mode and dark mode. This setting should persist between sessions, being saved as part of the user's preferences.

**Benefits:**
- **Improved User Comfort**: Reduces eye strain and improves usability in low-light conditions.
- **Increased Customizability**: Allows users to personalize their interface according to their preferences.
- **Energy Saving on OLED Displays**: Can reduce energy consumption for devices with OLED screens.

**Implementation Details:**
- A new toggle switch should be added under `Settings > Display Options`.
- Implement CSS variables or use existing CSS frameworks that support easy theming.
- Ensure that all components have appropriately themed colors in dark mode to maintain readability and visual accessibility.

**Potential Challenges:**
- Ensuring that all elements are legible in dark mode, including third-party components.
- Adapting images and icons to fit both themes without loss of clarity.

**Mockups and Diagrams:**
- Here is a basic mockup of the toggle option in the settings menu:
